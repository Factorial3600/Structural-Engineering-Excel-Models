# Simply Supported Beam Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This project is an Excel-based structural analysis tool for a simply supported beam subjected to uniformly distributed load (UDL).

It was developed to reinforce understanding of structural analysis concepts and to demonstrate how data analysis tools can be applied in civil engineering design.

## Features
- User-defined input section
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Total load
  - Maximum bending moment
  - Maximum shear force
  - Maximum deflection
- Serviceability check using L/250 deflection limit
- Dynamic chart showing the effect of span on bending moment
- Protected formula cells for safe use

## Engineering Concepts Covered
- Load combination
- Bending moment and shear force
- Serviceability limit state (deflection)
- Structural behaviour visualization

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## How to Use
1. Enter beam span and loading values in the input section.
2. Review calculated bending moment, shear force, and deflection.
3. Check serviceability PASS/FAIL result.
4. Observe how changes in span affect bending moment through the chart.
